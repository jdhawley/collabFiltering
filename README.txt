In order to use the program, Python 3 must be installed.

In order to run the program, use the command "python3 main.py". You will be asked to select whether you want a
prediction for part 1 or part 2.

Once you have selected which part you want to use, you will be prompted to enter a row and a column to predict. Note,
the rows and columns are zero-based.
